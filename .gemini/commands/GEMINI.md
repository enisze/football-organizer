# Project: My Awesome TypeScript Library

## General Instructions:

- When generating new TypeScript code, please follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure all new functions and classes have JSDoc comments.
- Prefer functional programming paradigms where appropriate.
- All code should be compatible with TypeScript 5.0 and Node.js 18+.

## Coding Style:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use functional components.
- Private class members should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).

## Regarding Dependencies:

- Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- If a new dependency is required, please state the reason.
- Use new dependencies if developer experience is significantly improved or if it provides substantial benefits over existing solutions.

## Linting and Formatting:

- Use Biome for linting and formatting. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues and `npm run format` to automatically fix them.

## Testing:

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Use Jest for testing. Run `npm test` to execute tests.

## Workflow Documentation:

- For guidelines on creating well-structured GitHub issues, refer to `issues.md`.
- For the workflow on implementing code changes based on a GitHub issue, refer to `work.md`.
